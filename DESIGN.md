# World of Warcraft: Legends -- RPG TCG

*Design Document v1.0*

## 1. Core Concept

A hybrid **role-playing trading card game** (RPG TCG) set in the **World
of Warcraft universe**. Players build decks that represent **heroes,
abilities, gear, allies, and quests**, then battle opponents while
progressing through campaigns or PvP skirmishes. Unlike traditional
TCGs, progression mechanics (leveling, loot, and faction reputation) add
long-term RPG depth.

## 2. Player Goals

-   **Collect**: Acquire new cards (heroes, spells, dungeons, loot).\
-   **Progress**: Level up chosen hero characters across sessions.\
-   **Compete**: Duel other players in PvP or co-op raid bosses.\
-   **Strategize**: Build synergistic decks representing WoW playstyles
    (Warrior tanking, Rogue combos, Warlock summoning, etc.).

## 3. Game Pillars

1.  **Authentic Warcraft Flavor** -- Heroes, abilities, and factions
    reflect WoW lore.\
2.  **Hybrid Progression** -- Deckbuilding + RPG leveling + loot.\
3.  **Flexible Modes** -- PvP duels, co-op raids, and campaign
    questing.\
4.  **Faction Identity** -- Alliance vs. Horde theme integrated into
    deck mechanics.

## 4. Game Flow

### Setup

-   Each player chooses **1 Hero Card** (e.g., Jaina Proudmoore -- Mage,
    Thrall -- Shaman).\
-   Build a **Hero Deck**:
    -   40--60 cards.\
    -   Must follow hero's **class restrictions**.\
    -   Cards split into **Abilities, Allies, Equipment, Quests,
        Consumables**.

### Gameplay Phases

1.  **Start Phase** -- Draw 5 cards, mulligan.\
2.  **Resource Phase** -- Players may place 1 card face-down as a
    **Resource** (mana/energy).\
3.  **Main Phase** -- Play cards:
    -   **Abilities** (spells, class skills).\
    -   **Allies** (minions, mercenaries, summons).\
    -   **Equipment** (weapons, armor, trinkets).\
    -   **Consumables** (potions, scrolls, foods).\
    -   **Quests** (side objectives that give rewards when completed).\
4.  **Combat Phase** -- Attack with hero or allies. Defenders assign
    blockers.\
5.  **End Phase** -- Effects resolve, turn passes.

## 5. Win Conditions

-   **Standard**: Reduce enemy hero's health to 0.\
-   **Quest Victory (PvE mode)**: Complete campaign quests or defeat
    raid bosses.\
-   **Reputation Victory (Campaign)**: Accumulate X reputation points
    with your faction.

## 6. RPG Progression Layer

Unlike typical TCGs, WoW RPG TCG includes **persistent progression**:

-   **Hero Leveling**
    -   Heroes gain XP from winning duels or completing quests.\
    -   Level-ups unlock **Talent Trees** (3 per class, like WoW).\
    -   Talent bonuses can modify deckbuilding rules (e.g., Fire Mage
        talent reduces cost of Fire spells).
-   **Loot System**
    -   After matches or campaign quests, players earn **Loot Cards**
        (rare equipment, mounts, vanity items).\
    -   Loot integrates into decks as **Equipment** cards.
-   **Faction Reputation**
    -   Completing campaign quests raises **faction rep** (e.g., Argent
        Dawn, Warsong Clan).\
    -   Unlocks unique faction cards.

## 7. Card Types

### Hero Cards

-   Defines: Class, Faction, Health, Starting Ability.\
-   Example:\
    **Thrall, Warchief of the Horde**
    -   Class: Shaman\
    -   Health: 30\
    -   Power: *Chain Lightning -- Deal 2 damage split among enemies.*

### Ability Cards

-   Class-specific spells/skills.\
-   Example: *Frostbolt -- Deal 3 damage to a target, Freeze it next
    turn.*

### Ally Cards

-   Represent summoned creatures, mercenaries, or lore characters.\
-   Example: *Grunt of Orgrimmar -- 2 ATK, 2 HP, Taunt.*

### Equipment Cards

-   Weapons, armor, trinkets.\
-   Example: *Ashkandi, Greatsword of the Brotherhood -- +5 ATK,
    Unique.*

### Quest Cards

-   Sub-objectives that reward cards, loot, or XP.\
-   Example: *Defeat 3 Undead Allies → Reward: Draw 2 cards.*

### Consumable Cards

-   One-time use: potions, food, scrolls.\
-   Example: *Healing Potion -- Restore 5 HP to hero.*

## 8. Game Modes

1.  **Skirmish (PvP)** -- 1v1 duels with custom decks.\
2.  **Battlegrounds (Team PvP)** -- 2v2 or 3v3 with shared objectives.\
3.  **Dungeon Runs (Co-Op PvE)** -- Players face scripted encounters and
    bosses.\
4.  **Raid Bosses (Epic PvE)** -- Multiple players team up against a
    single powerful AI deck (e.g., Ragnaros).\
5.  **Campaign (Solo/Co-Op)** -- Story-driven quests with persistent
    hero progression.

## 9. Economy & Collection

-   **Booster Packs**: Contain random mix of common/rare/epic/legendary
    cards.\
-   **Loot Drops**: Earned from PvE content, not obtainable from packs
    (keeps PvE rewarding).\
-   **Crafting**: Dismantle extra cards into resources to craft desired
    cards.

## 10. Example Deck Archetypes

-   **Hunter Beastmaster** -- Allies with synergies, pet companions.\
-   **Rogue Combo** -- Cheap abilities chaining into big damage turns.\
-   **Priest Healer/Control** -- Healing and buffing allies while
    draining enemies.

## 11. Visual & Thematic Style

-   Art style: Painted, WoW-inspired high fantasy (similar to
    Hearthstone but darker, more epic).\
-   UI: Resembles parchment spellbooks & faction banners.\
-   Sound: Iconic WoW spell sounds, ambient tavern/raid music.

## 12. Differentiation vs Hearthstone

-   Persistent **RPG hero leveling**.\
-   **Talent tree customization** changes deck rules.\
-   **Loot system** adds RPG grind and deck evolution.\
-   **Quests & Reputation** integrate WoW's faction lore.\
-   Co-op **Dungeon & Raid** content -- narrative-driven TCG PvE.
